Despite wide adoption of the pixel tags throughout advertisers sites, <b>40% of the data sent is still found to be inaccurate, which has a direct impact on the optimization of marketers ads.</b></p>

            <h2>Product Goal(s)</h2>
            <p>In order to hit our business goals, and meet the high skepticism that comes with automating a process that handles sensitive data, we focused on three specific goals.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Goal 1:</b> Measure perceived accuracy of the manual data currently being sent, versus the new automatic data.</li>
              <li><b>Goal 2:</b> Improve the model to meet or exceed the manual data being reported.</li>
              <li><b>Goal 3:</b> Give advertisers the clarity and control needed to modify the suggested data we were sending their way.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These goals were set not just in order to hit our teams metrics and solve the user problem, but also to build trust with the sales and support teams that ultimately answer to any customer friction.</p>

        <!--Section 4: Goal 1-->
        <div class="goal-1 section">
            <h2>Goal 1: How do we measure perceived accuracy?</h2>
            <h3>Getting ahead of the machine learning</h3>
            <p class="overview-paragraph">Because machine learning in this field, and team, was so new, skepticism had to match with a measurable indicator of trust from marketers. We wanted to get feedback from advertisers before the machine learning predictions were ready to be applied. If we were to wait for the model and the interface to be ready and built, we risked going without advertiser feedback for over a quarter - so we stepped in earlier.</p>
            <!--Research-->
            <h3>Goal(s) of research</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>To to gauge what people expected an automed process could deliver in the form of data accuracy and coverage.</li>
              <li>To get feedback on the framing of this new automated data in their current workflow and the way they quantify accuracy.</li>
            </ol>

            <!--Gathering feedback-->
            <h3>Gathering feedback</h3>
            <p class="overview-paragraph">By working with our engineers to show our advertisers a sample of the model results, we were able to learn not more about the data, but exactly what in the data advertisers were looking for when evaluating accuracy.</p>

            <!--Outcomes-->
            <h3>Outcomes(s) of the research</h3>
            <p>Despite people asking for a large amount of control and granularity, their reactions to the prototype actually contrasted this sentiment. We discovered this in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>When we asked marketers how the model should configure their website, with a diagram of their own user flow in front of them, they were actually unsure themselves about how they would want to see their website label and configured. We treated them as the ultimate models; expecting a precise answer because they knew their platforms the best. Turns out, even our control is naturally inaccurate.</li>
                <li>When we showed developers a mock of their dashboard, we actually fudged the numbers to decrease the accuracy by ~20% higher or lower than the real data. We were expecting people to be thrown by the new numbers. But they were not, even when we directly asked if these were correct and they testified that they know their businesses numbers well.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition to this, we also gained valuable feedback of how this suggested data, fits best into their workflow.</p>

          <h2>Goal 2: How do we improve the model, while also still building it?</h2>
          <h3>Releasing based on perceived confidence</h3>
          <p>After working out a framework for measuring perceived accuracy, we went forward with rolling out the model incrementally. By rolling the model out to one cohort at a time, we were able to collect feedback and correct the model based quickly.</p>

            <p>After we distilled what metrics were important to measuring accuracy, we set out to design a tool that allowed users to control what parts of the automated data should applied.</p>
            <!--Product Exploration-->
            <div class="section image-section">
              <h3>Part 1: Product exploration</h3>
              <p>By putting a an interface to a predictive machine learning model, we got the chance to see what people did and did not expect in terms of control. Protoypes of the controls the flow that went with it were put through various rounds of testing with feedback distilled screen by screen, as we trimmed down functionality for an Alpha release.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>It is easy to lose sight of the user problem, when a cool technology like machine learning is involved. But it's important to be constantly re-iterating the user problem, and reminding your team that you are there to solve a user's problem and not build a technology.</li>
                <li>There may be no “right” answer when it comes to counting and measuring a subjective flow. The quantifiable truth is subjective! Therefore, it’s about matching advertiser expectations but not being afraid to deviate from that a bit.</li>
                <li>As a team trying to serve customers that are also experts in your field, you need to be even more critical about building what they are asking for; and focus on what is needed. A more robust, but complex tool that was asked for would have bogged down our user.</li>
