          <h2>The Business Challenge</h2>
          <p class="overview-paragraph">After working with several artists in the ticket industry pioneering the movement to stop ticket scalping (Eric Church, Mumford and Sons) and building multiple one-off tools for their anti scalping efforts, we began to gain a better understanding of the massive obstacle that is professional ticket scalping - and saw the opportunity in removing scalpers from the equation.</p>
          <p>Approximately <b>60% of prime tickets are purchased through bots</b>, leading to <b>20% of tickets appearing on the secondary market</b> within 24 hours.</p>

        <p class="section section-bottom">We knew that unless we were able to secure the ticket supply for the fans and the fans only, they would continually face limited to no options when competing against professional scalpers. Not only where fans losing out on tickets, but they were also paying higher prices while the artist themselves failed to capitalize on the markup of these tickets. The problem was hurting both the artist and the fans directly and indirectly.</p>

            <h2>Product Goal(s)</h2>
            <p>In order to achieve a cross product and cross organization goal, we had to divide our product goal into three core focuses:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Goal 1:</b> Identify real fans from scalpers with a registration application that can be used for any and all artists.</li>
              <li><b>Goal 2:</b> Design a seamless access control and purchase experience for one of the largest ticket onsales in UK history.</li>
              <li><b>Goal 3:</b> Develop and design a series of tools that would allow our operations to identify and cancel scalper tools in real time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For every stage, from the fan facing apps that received 20+ millions impressions, to the internal tools that were used by only a handful of employees, I lead the design of these products to make sure that we hit the sweet spot and combined our efforts to stop scalpers.</p>

        <!--Section 3: Fan identification App-->

          <h2>Goal 1: How do we identify an artist's fans?</h2>
          <p class="overview-paragraph">In order to unlock the artist’s ticket inventory, we had to identify the scalpers from the find. It’s the equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack.</p>

          <!--Prototyping-->
          <h3>Gut checking with a prototype</h3>
          <p>We started with the basic information from the fan, but had to be discreet as to exactly what we were doing with this information and why. This may come off as dishonest, but if we were to reveal the intent behind collecting the fans data, then our cover (and the artists cover) would be blown.</p>
          <p>From there it was a balancing act of creating a convincing user experience for the fan without giving away the true reason of the entire product. Prototyping for contextual feedback was critical in determining key value propositions throughout the flow.</p>

        <div class="internal-tools section">
            <h2>Goal 3: How do we speed up our internal processes?</h2>
            <div class="overview-paragraph">
              <p>In addition to only selling tickets to known fans, there were a series of methods that we had available in order to identify scalper orders and cancel these orders.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, these methods were not scalable.</p>
              <p>Our team was faced with a series of time consuming tasks that made the overall process impractical and inaccurate for larger artists. This process was taking on average, 90 to 120 minutes per event, which total was roughly 1,980 - 2,640 hours of work per tour (for an average tour of 22 shows).</p>
              <p>What we needed was a streamlined process that required fewer tools involved, fewer steps and less overall time to complete the task.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Measurable product goal</h3>
            <p>Reduce time spent per event to 30-45 minutes, reducing the required people amount of people to three to cover an onsale consisting of 22 concerts or fewer.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            By shadowing one of our employees for several days and she went through the current process, it became evident that there was room for improvement through the consolidation of modification of her set of tools. The products and methodologies that she was currently using was not optimized for this new task at hand.</p>

              <p class="image-caption text-center light small">Identifying the key aspects and then stepping back to identify a solution was beneficial to the incremental product improvement process.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The outcome of the research was a documentation of the current flow and it’s pain point, and also an identification of the features that were (and were not used) throughout her toolset.</p>

            <div class="section section-top">
              <h3>Internal tooling prototyping</h3>
              <p>What followed was a series of prototypes built not in Framer JS or Sketch, but in Looker mySQL reporting and Google Sheets. Using these tools allowed us to make tweaks to the process in real time with little to no developer time needed.</p>
              <div class="section section-top image-section">
                <img class="img-responsive image-margin" src="img/songkick/fighting_for_fans/google-sheets-prototype.png">
                <p class="image-caption text-center light small">Not the sleekest of prototypes, but this Google spreadsheet proved to reduce the process time by over 20% (+22%.)</p>
              </div>
              <p>The solution was not one feature, but a set of improvements across multiple products. It was a combination of enhancements to our internal tools, communication tools and a table to be returned from our mySql table. Together, this resulted in a 50% reduction in time that it took to complete the task per event.</p>

          <p class="overview-paragraph">In the end, we identified scalpers and sold tickets for multiple campaigns, most notable being Adele’s UK and North American tours.</p>
          <ul class="key-results-list">
            <li>Successfully signed up over 35,000 fans through the registration app. Of those fans, we were able to identify enough scalpers to eventually block an estimated 235,000 tickets.</li>
            <li>Sold over 235,000 tickets total at 1.3x our standard purchase conversion rate.</li>
            <li>Reduced the anti-scalping process by 50% which allowed us to block over 10,000 scalpers after the onsale.</li>
